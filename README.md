compares prices of auto parts

  This is still a work in progress. When finished it will compare the price of an auto part with 
different suppliers. Then it will give the prices of the item for the different suppliers, listed
from lowest to highest. Then you can click on the store price you like and redirect the main 
content section to the supplier's web-site. 

This was an idea collaboration between myself and a friend that's a mechanic. He felt that
it would aide him in getting the cheapest part with-in the shortest time frame.
